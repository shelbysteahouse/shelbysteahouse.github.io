# If you're hosting on GitHub Pages, use the github-pages gem.
# This gem installs all the dependencies that GitHub Pages uses to build your site,
# ensuring consistency between your local environment and GitHub's build process.
# This also implicitly installs the correct Jekyll version for GitHub Pages.
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# To add any other Jekyll plugins not included in github-pages, list them here.
# For example, jekyll-feed is usually included with github-pages, but if you needed
# a specific version or another unique plugin:
# gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.17"

# To get the latest Bundler and other useful development tools:
group :development do
  gem "bundler", "~> 2.4" # Or the latest major version of Bundler (check `bundle -v`)
  # Add other development-only gems here if needed, e.g., linters
end

# Add any other gems your Jekyll site might explicitly need for custom scripts or features.
# For example, if you were using a specific library in a custom Jekyll plugin.
# gem "nokogiri"
